      <p class="description">
        The Chia Collective is a WordPress project. This project was part of the initial stages for The Chia Collective start-up.
        The Chia Collective creative team was comprised of a graphic designer, a photographer and a coder. I was part of the
        team as a coder and laid the ground work for the website’s layout and functionality.
        Since I was part of the project the Chia Collective website has kept its layout and functionality, however the content is frequently updated.
        At the end of 2017 I exited the project passing the content update aspect of the Chia Collective website to one of the company’s owners.
